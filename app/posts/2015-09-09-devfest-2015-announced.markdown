The Google Developer Groups of Hamburg are proud to announce the second annual GDG DevFest Hamburg - the largest Google related event in northern Germany.
Like last year, the event will be held on **5-6 November at the Bethaus Hamburg**. Put aside all your work and join us for 2 days of fun and interesting technologies, together with other developers, hackers, geeks and other experts of our industry.

### What to expect

* **Workshops** – on the 1st day (5/11) we will start in the early afternoon and focus completely on workshops/codelabs around mobile- and the web technologies.
* **Conference** – the 2nd day (6/11) starts early in the morning for us and brings 2 parallel conference tracks dedicated to Android/Mobile and Web/Cloud
* **Audience** – this year we plan for roughly 200 participants of Google technologies interested people like you!
* **Venue** – after a smaller DevFest last year at Xing (thx for that!), we need a bigger venue this time! So we were able to arrange something with the Betahaus Hamburg, a central and very well known event location here in Hamburg.

As a announcement bonus we are very happy that we already can announce our first speaker: [Surma](https://plus.google.com/+AlexanderSurma). As a native "Hamburger" and former GDG Organizer of GDG Berlin Golang and now Developer Relations Engineer at Google in London, we are especially pleased for him giving a presentation about [HTTP/2 for developers](http://www.devfest.de/#!/speakers/1) at this years event! But stay tuned, there are more to come...

P.S. if you are also interested to join us as a speaker, feel free to [apply](http://goo.gl/forms/MDTttSCkgr).
